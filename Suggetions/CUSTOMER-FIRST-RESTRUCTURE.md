# 🎯 E-SOFT COMPLETE WEBSITE RESTRUCTURE
## Customer-First Information Architecture

---

## 🧠 STRATEGIC PRINCIPLE

**Current Problem:** Website is too technical. Customers don't understand WHAT the product does, WHY they need it, or HOW it helps them.

**New Approach:** "See Yourself → Understand Problem → Discover Solution → Take Action"

---

## 📊 CUSTOMER JOURNEY MAPPING

### Stage 1: AWARENESS (I have a problem)
**Customer Thinking:** "My geyser keeps breaking / My skin feels dry / I'm tired of buying salt bags"

### Stage 2: CONSIDERATION (What are my options?)
**Customer Thinking:** "Should I buy a salt softener? Is there something better?"

### Stage 3: EVALUATION (Does this solve MY problem?)
**Customer Thinking:** "Will this work for MY home/factory/hotel?"

### Stage 4: DECISION (How do I get started?)
**Customer Thinking:** "How much does it cost? How do I install it?"
